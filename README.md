# developmental_constraints_genome_evolution
Developmental constraints on genome evolution in four bilaterian model species
1. we use fun_ciRatio.R and transcriptomeIndex.R to compare confidence interval ratio of  transcriptome index for different expression transformation.  
2. we use fun_transcriptoemIndex.R and transcriptomeIndex.R to calculate and plot transcriptomen index for sequence evolution, gene age and paralog number.
3. we use pleiotropyTest.R to generate temporal pleiotropy analysis related results.
4. we use retroGeneExp.R to plot the expression of retrogene across development.
5. we use connecDupCor.R to analyse correlation between connectivity and duplicability.
